# Monospaced Fonts

Mono fonts are a mainstay of developer IDE and text editors alike.
They allow for a clean, consistent look and feel when writing or reading code.

## Italics

Personally I am a fan of Monospaced fonts that have good italic support.
They are wonderful to work with when your editor and theme supports them, like
[Monokai Operator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=markfknight.monokai-operator-theme)
does in VS Code.

## Cursive Italics

Although unusual at first, there is something quite pleasing to the eye when you
see a cursive font in an editor. When your eyes adjust to the subtle highlighting
of keywords and comments it makes your code a pleasure to behold.
I would highly recommend trying a font that has cursive italics, you may never
go back!

## Ligatures

Yes please! They help simplify code and help to keep spacing for common symbols.

# Font Choices

## Operator Mono

The first mono font that I used supporting good editing italics was
[Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator). A pretty
font that comes at a cost and unfortunately does not support ligatures out of the
box. Ligatures can be added with help from
[Operator Mono Lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig)).

## Dank Mono

One of the most wonderful fonts I have used in an editor.
[Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) is well designed for all displays, especially rentia;
comes with ligature support, and is a fair bit cheaper than Operator Mono.
The font has been stable for sometime and has been my go to since it was released
in 2018.

## Fira Code

The first font I used with ligature support was
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). A lovely monospaced font without
the fuss of italics. Free and open source.

## JetBrains Mono

New out from JetBrains, [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
Clear and easy to read, has great ligatures and italics and although the italics
are not cursive a pleasure to use.
Free and open source and the default for JetBrains products, it looks great with
a dark theme.
I'm really hoping a cursive variant of this font appears someday.
