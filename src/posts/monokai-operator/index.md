[Monokai Operator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=markfknight.monokai-operator-theme) is a theme for Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

It is based on the VSCode Monokai theme, with customisations for italics making it ideal for use with fonts like [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) or [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh).

There are three flavours detailed below:

  - Italicised code keywords, attributes and comments

- Monokai Operator Code

  - Default VS Code Monokai theme with italicised attributes and comments

- Monokai Operator Mono
  - Non-italic code keywords with italicised attributes and comments
